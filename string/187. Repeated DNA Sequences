All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
Example:
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

class Solution {
public:
vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    vector<string> r;
    long t = 0, i = 0, ss = s.size();
    while (i < 9)
        t = t << 3 | s[i++] & 7;
    while (i < ss)
        if (m[t = t << 3 & 0x3FFFFFFF | s[i++] & 7]++ == 1)
            r.push_back(s.substr(i - 10, 10));
    return r;
}
};
