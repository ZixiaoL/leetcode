Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        for(int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            if(binary_search(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end(), target))return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
