//There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, 
//you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb 
//(turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i-th round, 
//you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.


//奇数个因数才会是开的，只有平方数有奇数个因数，所以返回平方数的个数
int bulbSwitch(int n) {
    return sqrt(n);
}
