//Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each 
//citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
//According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h 
//citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."
